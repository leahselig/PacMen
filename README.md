# PacMen Exercise

<img src="PacmenScreenshot.jpg" alt="Multiple PacMen on the screen">

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course.

This project creates animated PacMen. Each time the "Add PacMan" button is pressed, a new PacMan is created at a different place on the screen. Once you like the amount of PacMen, the "Start Game" button can be clicked. This will cause the PacMen to start moving in all directions at different velocities. The PacMen also have collision detection when they hit the edge of the screen.

This was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## How To Run

Download index.html, pacmen.js, and all image files by clicking the green code button. Make sure to save them to the same directory on your computer. Load the index.html file into your browser. Press the "Add PacMan" button until you are satisfied with the quantity and then press the "Start Game" button to watch the PacMen move around the screen.

You can also interact with the page without having to download the files.
